I want you to come up with an implementation plan to completely revamp the approach this SDK takes regarding structured output. It's currently not an intutive devx and it does not include the structured output as part of the main agent loop which prevents us from getting things like metrics etc. I really like how pydanticai SDK does it and would like you to implement this SDK structured output approach to be more aligned with their approach. You can keep our current methods for backwards compatibility but you should allow users to pass in the output type via the actual agent invocation which would make it much more intutive. You can read all about how pydanticai implements structured output by reading the following file: "/Users/aaron/dev/junk/strands/sdk-python/pydanticai.md". Write your implementation plan to "/Users/aaron/dev/junk/strands/sdk-python/.planning/implementation.md"
