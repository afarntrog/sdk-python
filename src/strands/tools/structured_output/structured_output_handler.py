    """Handles structured output tool execution and state management.
    
    This class manages the lifecycle of structured output tools, including:
    - Tracking expected tool names from output schemas
    - Managing state storage using namespaced keys ({BASE_KEY}_{tool_use_id})
    - Extracting and cleaning up structured output results
    
    State Management Approach:
        Each structured output result is stored in the invocation_state using a key pattern:
        "{BASE_KEY}_{tool_use_id}" where tool_use_id is the unique identifier for 
        each tool execution. This prevents collisions and allows for targeted cleanup.
        
        The handler maintains a set of expected_tool_names based on the output_schema
        to quickly identify which tool uses are structured output tools.
